                               non-negligible introduce a penalty on their densities\n"

        rays_sample_startidx `[n_rays]`: i-th element is the index of the first sample in z_vals,
                                         densities, and rgbs of the i-th ray
        rays_n_samples `[n_rays]`: i-th element is the number of samples for the i-th ray

        bgs `[n_rays, 3]`: background colors of each ray
        dss [total_samples]: it means `ds`s, the notation `ds` comes from the article "Local and
                             global illumination in the volume rendering integral" written by Nelson
                             Max and Min Chen, 2005.  The product of `ds[i]` and `densities[i]`
                             represents the probability of the ray terminates anywhere between
                             `z_vals[i]` and `z_vals[i]+ds[i]`.
                             Note that `ds[i]` is _not_ the same as `z_vals[i+1]-z_vals[i]` (though
                             they may equal), because: (1) if empty spaces are skipped during ray
                             marching, `z_vals[i+1]-z_vals[i]` may be very large, in which case it's
                             no longer appropriate to assume the density is constant along this
                             large segment; (2) `z_vals[i+1]` is not defined for the last sample.
        z_vals [total_samples]: z_vals[i] is the distance of the i-th sample from the camera
        drgbs [total_samples, 4]: density (1) and rgb (3) values along a ray

        measured_batch_size `uint`: total number of samples that got composited into output
