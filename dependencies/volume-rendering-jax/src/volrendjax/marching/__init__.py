    Given a pack of rays (`rays_o`, `rays_d`), their intersection time with the scene bounding box
    (`t_starts`, `t_ends`), and an occupancy grid (`occupancy_bitfield`), generate samples along
    each ray.

    Inputs:
        total_samples `int`: ,
        diagonal_n_steps `int`: the length of a minimal ray marching step is calculated internally
                                as:
                                    Œîùë° := ‚àö3 / diagonal_n_steps;
                                the NGP paper uses diagonal_n_steps=1024 (as described in appendix
                                E.1).
        K `int`: total number of cascades of `occupancy_bitfield`
        G `int`: occupancy grid resolution, the paper uses 128 for every cascade
        bound `float`: the half length of the longest axis of the scene‚Äôs bounding box,
                       e.g. the `bound` of the bounding box [-1, 1]^3 is 1
        stepsize_portion: next step size is calculated as t * stepsize_portion, the paper uses 1/256

        rays_o `[n_rays, 3]`: ray origins
        rays_d `[n_rays, 3]`: **unit** vectors representing ray directions
        t_starts `[n_rays]`: time of the ray entering the scene bounding box
        t_ends `[n_rays]`: time of the ray leaving the scene bounding box
        noises `broadcastable to [n_rays]`: noises to perturb the starting point of ray marching
        occupancy_bitfield `[K*(G**3)//8]`: the occupancy grid represented as a bit array, grid
                                            cells are laid out in Morton (z-curve) order, as
                                            described in appendix E.2 of the NGP paper

    Returns:
        measured_batch_size_before_compaction `int`: total number of generated samples of all rays
        ray_is_valid `bool` `[n_rays]`: a mask, where a true value denotes the ray's gradients
                                        should flow, even if there are no samples generated for it
        idcs `[total_samples]`: indices indicating which ray the i-th sample comes from.
        rays_n_samples `[n_rays]`: number of samples of each ray, its sum is `total_samples`
                                   referenced below
        rays_sample_startidx `[n_rays]`: indices of each ray's first sample
        xyzs `[total_samples, 3]`: spatial coordinates of the generated samples, invalid array
                                   locations are masked out with zeros
        dirs `[total_samples, 3]`: spatial coordinates of the generated samples, invalid array
                                   locations are masked out with zeros.
        dss `[total_samples]`: `ds`s of each sample, for a more detailed explanation of this
                               notation, see documentation of function `volrendjax.integrate_rays`,
                               invalid array locations are masked out with zeros.
        z_vals `[total_samples]`: samples' distances to their origins, invalid array
                                  locations are masked out with zeros.
